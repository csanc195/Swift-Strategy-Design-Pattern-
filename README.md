# Swift-Strategy-Design-Pattern-
This is a simple Swift playground which shows in simple terms the concept of the Strategy Design pattern

This is the <b>STRATEGY DESIGN PATTERN</b> interpreted by me in Swift,
this is a simple Swift playground that serves as proof of concept
notice that the book <i>"Head First Design Patterns by Eric Freeman
and Elisabeth Robson in Java"</i> was used as reference, the following principles
can be found in this book under <i>"Strategy Design Pattern"</i>
the following principles are also described in the book:
<h3>Design Principles:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Identify aspects of your application that vary and separate them from what stays the same.</li>
<li>Program to an interface, not an implementation.</li>
<li>Favor composition over inheritance.</li>
</ul>
